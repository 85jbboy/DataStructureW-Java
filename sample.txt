Carpe Diem!

Heaven is real. I really believe in Jesus Christ.
Today, I had a kind of bad feeling about my gloomy future. But after all,
I remind the Man above who has been alive from the beginning, the Creator.
Jesus loves me absolutely, and he know the way that I am walking.
God will make a way where it seems to be no way. Though I do not have any
idea where I'm heading to, God will lead my life just as he has been.
By the way, I decided to be a Java Programmer. I hope it is not too hard to 
be employed after the programming education. God, Lead me.. Help me..
I really need you more than yesterday, I need you Lord.
more than the air I breathe
more than the song I song
I need you more, I need you Lord. 

I just came back home with lovely Mom filled with grace of God this morning.
I heard that my Dad was given the grace from the summon today, so he replied a couple of times with loud Amen.
It is so happy to hear that from Mom. 

I planned the study schedule for three weeks preparing for new class starts in January 29th.
During the three weeks break, I planned to learn linux centOS, Data Structure with Java, MySQL, and Engineer Information Processing license.
I'm so excited. Let's play with Computer Programming! Carpe Diem!! 

Tomorrow is mystery, but today is a gift! Let's walk with God having hope toward my Lord, Christ Jesus.
Hallelujah Amen!
